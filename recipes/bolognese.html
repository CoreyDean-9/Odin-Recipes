    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Bolognese sauce [a]</strong> known in Italian as ragù alla bolognese[b] or ragù bolognese (called ragù in the city of Bologna, ragó in Bolognese dialect), is a meat-based sauce in Italian cuisine, typical of the city of Bologna.[2] It is customarily used to dress tagliatelle al ragù and to prepare lasagne alla bolognese.</p>
    <p><strong>talian ragù alla bolognese</strong> is a slowly cooked meat-based sauce, and its preparation involves several techniques, including sweating, sautéing and braising. Ingredients include a characteristic soffritto of onion, celery, and carrot, different types of minced or finely chopped beef, often alongside small amounts of fatty pork. White wine, milk, and a small amount of tomato paste or tomato sauce are added, and the dish is then gently simmered at length to produce a thick sauce.</p>

            <p>Step 2</p>

            <p>Step 3</p>

        <li>
            <p>Final Step</p>
            <p><strong>Reduce heat to low and simmer,</strong> stirring often, until mixture cooks down into a thick sauce, at least 3 hours but preferably 4 to 6 hours. Skim fat from the top of sauce if desired. Add more water if sauce is too thick. Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.</p>
